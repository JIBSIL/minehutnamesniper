# minehutnamesniper
Snipe Minehut names with a configurable scraper, in Node.js!

## Project Info:
If you've wanted to get rare Minehut names using common words, this project is for you!

You will be able to get server names, from single-character names such as zBox and zJail, to names with words as a prefix or suffix - such as JailBox and BoxHome!

## How to get set up:
Getting set up is easy! Just follow these easy steps:
- Run `git clone https://github.com/JIBSIL/minehutnamesniper.git`
- Follow the instructions in the `config.txt` file to configure it as you wish
- Run `node allwords.js` and watch the names come in!
- Names will be printed out into the console and into the file specified in `OUTPUTFILE` from `config.txt`

## Contributing
Just send a PR, and I'll take a look at it as soon as possible. Please don't update dependencies to ES modules - commonjs compatibility is needed unless the PR updates the whole codebase.
