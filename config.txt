# This is a template string - it allows things to be appended to the start or end of it. For example:
# STRING=${word}Box - outputs TestBox
# STRING=Box${word} - outputs BoxTest
# STRING=${word} - outputs Test (default)
# ${word} is the word. Make sure not to set it to anything else or the code will error.
STRING=${word}Gens

# Is the output file deleted or left how it is to on program start?

# The file to output to
OUTPUTFILE=words.txt

# The number of words to generate

# Debug. DO NOT enable unless you want a lot of spam in your console (logs all words that are not available)
